# Terraform AWS VPC Setup with EC2 Instances

This Terraform automation script provides a quick setup to deploy a **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** in AWS. Inside this VPC, there's a public subnet that hosts three EC2 instances. The architecture ensures that the subnet has appropriate routing via a route table, is secured by a Network Access Control List (NACL), and has internet accessibility through an Internet Gateway.
